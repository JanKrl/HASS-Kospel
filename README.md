# AddDaemon script for Home Assistant - Kospel heaters (via Home Admin)
This is a POC script scrapping data from (Kospel Home Admin)[https://ha.kspel.pl]

Data is propagated to HomeAssistant as a set of sensors.

## Work in progress
I implemented only the most interesting (to me) elements of Home Admin.
It is possible to read much more data.
It is also possible to change settings.

If you find it interesting, feel free to open an issue (feature request) to get in contact.
